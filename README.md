#.Net Coding Challenge - Battle of monsters - Juan Pablo Masdeu

##Introduction
Welcome to our coding challenge! This challenge has been designed to test your coding skills and problem-solving abilities. 
We believe that challenges like this are a great way to push yourself and learn new things. 
The challenge is divided into two sections: the "Coding Challenge" and the "Problem-Solving Challenge".
The "Coding Challenge" will test your technology stack skills, while the "Problem-Solving Challenge" evaluates your ability to solve logic problems 
and the complexity of your algorithm. The code for both sections is in the same repository. 
Good luck, and have fun!
